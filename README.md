Aoccdrnig to a rscheearch ~at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy~, it deosn't mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoetnt tihng is taht the frist and lsat ltteer be at the rghit pclae. The rset can be a toatl mses and you can sitll raed it wouthit porbelm bcuseae the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef, but the wrod as a wlohe.

This is a simple program written in C++ that transforms a normal string into a tiyglcemyopa-style sirtng where the fisrt and lsat lteter saty in pclae but the mdidle ones are rmaodnly slbecarmd

This is currently a very simple implemenation that has its limitations and is probably far from efficient, but it works okay?
